Hello!

To execute this program, run the main method in the GrammarInput class. I tested and created this
project in intelliJ, but I'm assuming it will work for any Java IDE. Upon running,
you will be prompted to input a text file containing a valid grammar.
I have included three test files of increasing complexity, Test1.txt, Test2.txt, and Test3.txt

If you want to run your own grammar, create a new text file, and follow the following convention:

(Rule) -> (clause) | (clause)

The rule should be an uppercase letter, and the clause should a lowercase letter, a Rule, or Îµ

I have also provided some error cases, such as empty.txt.
If this is run, there are no strings that can be generated from this grammar, so the rules are empty.

There are multiple ways to generate a grammar in Chomsky, and my program recursively generates rules
until every rule has only two characters. This results in many new rules being created, however it
still follows the Chomsky formatting guidelines.

I hope you enjoy the project!
